=> These are some notes regarding how the AgentAC is structured.
=> The whole point of this document is the "Transition and animation speed details" part further down.
=> However, to keep things somewhat readable, I also wrote down some Miscellaneous notes.



****************************** Miscellaneous notes ******************************
=> I should mention that the scale of the human model is 0.29. This means that every imported animation for the human
should have a scale factor of 0.29.
=> Base Layer is where the movement animations play. When the agent is not attacking, Base Layer controls the whole body.
However, if the agent starts attacking, then Base Layer will lose control of some of the bones in the skeleton.
Those bones will be controlled by the AttackAndBlockLayer (or whatever else), but Base Layer will still control the rest
of the bones (most likely pelvis bone and its children).
=> AttackAndBlockLayer is where the attack and defend (aka: block) animations play out.
=> In this game, "def" has higher precedence than "atk", which explains the reason why the transition conditions
of "atk" and "def" states were set up the way they are.
=> "No exit time means" you don't have to wait for the animation to finish (before you transition to the next one).
=> combatDir is used to choose the desired combat direction for your attacks (atk) and blocks (def).
The following convention will be used for all directions:
	- combatDir=0 means up
	- combatDir=1 means right
	- combatDir=2 means down
	- combatDir=3 means left



****************************** Transition and animation speed details ******************************

=> IMPORTANT: All transitions are fixed durations, measured in seconds.
=> IMPORTANT: The playback speed of all animations is 60 frames per second.


******************** Getting Hurt ********************
=> All "getting_hurt" animations will get a speed multiplier of 2.
Normally, every "getting_hurt" animation has 40 frames, so that means 0.66 seconds.
However, with the speed multiplier, they will last 0.33 seconds.



******************** Attack ********************
=> Any transition which goes to any kind of "atk_hold" animation is considered to be "Attack Windup".
=> Any "atk_release" animation is considered to be "Attack Release".
=> Any transition which goes from any kind of "atk_release" to "idle" is considered to be "Attack Release Recovery".
=> Any transition which goes from any kind of "atk_bounced" to "idle" is considered to be "Attack Bounced Recovery".
=> The transition from any "atk_release" to "atk_bounced" does not have a name, but they all have a transition
duration of 0.1. This is only for making the animation visually smooth. It doesn't necessarily have any
"combat balance" considerations in mind.


----- Attack Transitions -----
=> Attack Windup transition times are 0.66 for swings, and 1.0 for stabs.
This is because, if stabs have 0.66 windup, then it's much harder to block them.
=> Attack Release Recovery times are 0.2.	
=> Attack Bounced Recovery times are 0.2.

=> NOTE: In the past, the above values were different. They had a "different balance" to them.
For example, the Attack Bounced Recovery used to be "0.66" instead of "0.2". However, after adding the
recent feature of having the ability to transition from [Attack Release/Bounced] to [Defend Hold]
(see "Defend Windup" below) with a transition value of 0.2, the aforementioned Attack Bounced Recovery value
has been changed from "0.66" to "0.2". This is done in order to avoid "animation skipping" exploit which can
be done by clever players.
=>
Here is an example of an "animation skipping" exploit which could have been done:
	- Transitioning from [Attack Release] to [Idle] is 0.66.
	- Transitioning from [Idle] to [Attack Hold] is 0.66.
	- The total transition time from [Attack Release] to [Idle] to [Attack Hold] is 1.32.
	This would have been intended by design.

However, a clever player could have bypassed the above by the following (new feature):
	- Transitioning from [Attack Release] to [Defend Hold] is 0.2.
	- Transitioning from [Defend Hold] to [Attack Hold] is 0.66.
	- The total transition time from [Attack Release] to [Defend Hold] to [Attack Hold] is 0.86.
	This 0.86 value is less than the intended 1.32 value.

Indeed, the new feature would have introduced several "animation skipping" exploits as above.
However, now that the transition durations are 0.2 in general, the players can transition from
[Attack Release/Bounce] to [Attack Hold] in 0.86 seconds total, regardless of what sort of
transitions are chosen.


----- Attack Animations -----
=> Attack Release animation speed will not be touched.
All attack animations are 40 frames long, so that means 0.66 seconds. 
=> Note that the [Attack Windup]->[Attack Release]->[Attack Release Recovery] duration for swings
in total is 0.66 + 0.66 + 0.2 = 1.52. This is basically 1.5 seconds. I think it looks good.



******************** Defend ********************
=> Any transition which goes to any kind of "def_hold" animation is considered to be "Defend Windup".
=> Any transition which goes from any kind of "def_hold" to "idle" is considered to be "Defend Release".
=> Any "def_blocked" animation is considered to be "Defend Blocked".
=> Any transition which goes from any kind of "def_blocked" to "idle" OR "def_hold" is considered
to be "Defend Blocked Recovery".


----- Defend Transitions -----
=> Good news! Any kind of transition duration will be 0.2 seconds no matter what.
This is to make sure that blocking is faster than attacks, so that the agents don't get spammed by attacks.


----- Defend Animations -----
=> By default, all Defend Blocked animations are 25 frames long, so that means roughly 0.416 seconds.
=> To make sure defending is more responsive, all Defend Blocked animations will have a HARDCODED multiplier of 4.0.
This means that Defend Blocked animations will last roughly 0.104 seconds.
