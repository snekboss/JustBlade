=> These are some notes regarding how the AgentAC is structured.
=> The whole point of this document is the "The transition details" part further down.
=> However, to keep things somewhat readable, I also wrote down some Miscellaneous notes.



****************************** Miscellaneous notes ******************************
=> Base Layer is where the movement animations play. When the agent is not attacking, Base Layer controls the whole body.
However, if the agent starts attacking, then Base Layer will lose control of some of the bones in the skeleton.
Those bones will be controlled by the AttackAndBlockLayer (or whatever else), but Base Layer will still control the rest
of the bones (most likely pelvis bone and its children).
=> AttackAndBlockLayer is where the attack and defend (aka: block) animations play out.
=> In this game, "def" has higher precedence than "atk", which explains the reason why the transition conditions
of "atk" and "def" states were set up the way they are.
=> "No exit time means" you don't have to wait for the animation to finish (before you transition to the next one).
=> combatDir is used to choose the desired combat direction for your attacks (atk) and blocks (def).
The following convention will be used for all directions:
	- combatDir=0 means up
	- combatDir=1 means right
	- combatDir=2 means down
	- combatDir=3 means left



****************************** The transition details ******************************
---------- Source: idle ----------
=> From idle to atk_hold:
	- No exit time.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.

=> From idle to def_hold:
	- No exit time.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.



---------- Source: atk ----------
=> From atk_hold to atk_release:
	- No exit time.
	- No transition duration (ie, normalized duration of 0%).

=> From atk_hold to def_hold:
	- No exit time.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.

=> From atk_release to atk_bounce:
	- No exit time.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.1 seconds.

=> From atk_release to idle:
	- Has exit time, with normalized time equal to 1.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.

=> From atk_bounce to idle:
	- Has exit time, with normalized time equal to 1.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.4 seconds.



---------- Source: def ----------
=> From def_hold to idle:
	- No exit time.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.

=> From def_hold to (different) def_hold:
	- No exit time.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.

=> From def_hold to def_blocked:
	- No exit time.
	- No transition duration (ie, normalized duration of 0%).

=> From def_hold to atk_hold:
	- No exit time.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.

=> From def_blocked to idle:
	- Has exit time, with normalized time equal to 1.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.

=> From def_blocked to def_hold:
	- Has exit time, with normalized time equal to 1.
	- Fixed transition, with a duration of 0.2 seconds.
