\section install_sec For End Users: Installation

\section archived_files Working with Archived Files

To install the game, you're going to need a program which can extract an archived .zip file.
Most machines nowadays come with operating systems which already include such programs.
However, in case you do not have a program which can work on an archived .zip file, I recommend installing 7zip first.

- Here is a link to their download page: https://www.7-zip.org/ .

The installation instructions written here will assume that the user has 7zip installed.

After making sure you have means of working with an archived file, follow the rest of the instructions below.

\section install_steps Installation Steps

Visit the download page of the game: https://bigsnack.itch.io/melee-tournament

Download the game's .zip file, and then follow the instructions below:

- Once you've downloaded the .zip file, right click on it. A context menu will open.
- In the context menu, look for "7-Zip", and click on it.
- Once clicked, a new menu will appear. Select "Extract Here".
- At this point, allow 7zip to work on extracting the archived file.
- When it is done, you'll see a new folder with the same name as the .zip file. However, this folder does not have a .zip extension.
- Double click on this new folder.
- You will see an executable file named "Melee Tournament.exe". Double click on this, and the game will run.
- Once the game running, you can take a look at the key bindings of the game from the main menu.
- Enjoy!
