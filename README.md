# Just Blade

This is my bachelor thesis work at UK MFF, which I successfully defended in 2024. It was my project for the Individual Software Project course at UK MFF, which I later elevated into a bachelor thesis.

I developed the game using Unity 2021.3.6f1, and the C# programming language for the scripts.
All the visual assets (3D models, rigging, animations) were made using Blender 2.76b in 2016, and belong to me (Ogulhan Bozkir).

The sounds are taken from various free assets in Unity's Asset Store. The credits to these sound assets were given in the main page of the auto-generated documentation.
